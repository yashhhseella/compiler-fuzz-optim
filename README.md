# Building a grey-box fuzzing framework that treats the compiler itself—not just application code—as the “fuzz target.”

No specific code or target problem was decided as of 5/15. Start with a small seed and do mutations to “crash on purpose”. Use LLM to generate seeds more efficiently. Debugging a compiler pass and searching for a specific pattern or generating or mutating the seed. Wondering if we can make a tool that can do fuzzing more effectively.
